# copy-paste-gadget-rotator
Very quick program that mirrors or flips axes of a schematic; select a file and an operation (flip X|Y|Z|XY|XZ|YZ) and it will modify the file.

Intended for CLI, but will pop up a couple dialog boxes for inputs if no arguments are provided

(for CLI help, give it an argument such as `?`, `-?`, or `help`)
